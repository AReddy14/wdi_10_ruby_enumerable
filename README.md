# Enumerable and Collections

To run the tests simply run `rspec` from your terminal. You may have to run `bundle` first to ensure you have everything installed. Test drive 100% of this, and do *not* use pry if possible.

## Instructions

Following the below rules, test drive the `lib/enum/basic_enum.rb` file by running `rspec` from the terminal. The tests, which are given, are in `spec/basic_enum_spec.rb`. **Do not modify the tests**. Answer the prompts using the methods linked to in the comments (there maybe be additional methods that you need as well). All of the `basic_enum` ones can be done in a single line.

Then move on to the `lib/enum/arrays.rb` and `lib/enum/nested.rb` files and test drive those as well. Those files don't have hints as to what methods to use!

Make commits as you progress, and then make a pull request at the end of this lab.

## Rules

- Do not assign any varibles
- Do not use the `.each` method unless specifically told to do such
- Do not user a `for` loop
- Do not modify the tests
- Do not modify other code that is marked to not be modified
- Do not write any input/output using puts or gets

You may find the [symbol to proc](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1217088/what-does-mapname-mean-in-ruby) is also highly useful for writing shorter code. You may end up chaining many methods in each method to get the expected result.
