# Enumerable and Collections

To run the tests simply run `rspec` from your terminal. You may have to run `bundle` first to ensure you have everything installed. Test drive 100% of this, and do not use pry if possible.

## Rules

- Do not assign any varibles
- Do not use the `.each` method unless specifically told to do such
- Do not user a `for` loop
- Do not modify the tests
- Do not modify other code that is marked to not be modified

You may create a new Hash (but do not assign it to a variable) and use the incrementor method `+=` as needed.

## Helpful Methods

- `.map` or `.collect`
- `.select`
- `.match`
- `.each_with_object`
- `.flatten`
- `.reduce`
- `.inject`
- `.flatten`
- `.size` or `.length`

You may find the [symbol to proc](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1217088/what-does-mapname-mean-in-ruby) is also highly useful for writing shorter code. You may end up chaining many methods in each method to get the expected result.
