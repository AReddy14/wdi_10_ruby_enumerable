# Enumerable and Collections

To run the tests simply run `rspec` from your terminal. You may have to run `bundle` first to ensure you have everything installed. Test drive 100% of this, and do not use pry if possible.

## Beta Test Instructions

Test drive the `lib/enum/basic_enum_spec.rb` file. Do not modify the tests. You will find documentation pointing to helpful methods that are likely to be useful in answering the `lib/enum/basic_enum_spec.rb` prompts. Don't worry about other files in this repo.

## Rules

- Do not assign any varibles
- Do not use the `.each` method unless specifically told to do such
- Do not user a `for` loop
- Do not modify the tests
- Do not modify other code that is marked to not be modified

You may find the [symbol to proc](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1217088/what-does-mapname-mean-in-ruby) is also highly useful for writing shorter code. You may end up chaining many methods in each method to get the expected result.
