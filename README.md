# Enumerable and Collections



## Rules

- Do not assign any varibles
- Do not use the `.each` method
- Do not user a `for` loop
- Do not modify the tests

You may create a new Hash (but do not assign it to a variable) and use the incrementor method `+=` as needed.

## Helpful Methods

- `.map` or `.collect`
- `.select`
- `.match`
- `.each_with_object`
- `.flatten`
- `.reduce`
- `.inject`
- `.flatten`
- `.size` or `.length`

You may find the symbol to proc is also highly useful for writing shorter code. You may end up chaining many methods in each method to get the expected result.
